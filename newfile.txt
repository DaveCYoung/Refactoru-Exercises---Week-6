What is node?
	A javascript runtime envrionment 
	Client Side vs Server Side Javascript

How is node.js different from browser JS?

	No window object.
	No DOM 

	Modules - define what code needs to be shared between files.
	File system access - can do anything on your computer that you would do on your computer. 
	Networking access - can send/recieve requests 
	Hardware access 

	= Web Server 

Running script at command line much like calling function.  scripts can have arguments!

access command-line arguments with process.argv (arguments vector)

vector = list of values - essentially an array of arguments passed to script.  

process.argv[0] = node.  process.argv[1] = script that is being run.  process.argv[2 +] = arguments 

use module.exports and require() to share code between files.  whatever is exported in one file can be required in another.

require returns the value of module.exports.

FS module - file system access 

fs is a core module so you can require it by name.  you don't need to specify file path.
