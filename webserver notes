What happens when you put http://google.com into your browser?  

	HTTP - Protocol/Format for requests/responses

	Request goes to whatever server we are sending the address to.  

	IP address - indicates physical address of server.  

	DNS - domain name server - translates web addresses to IP addresses, sends back IP address 
	
	Request goes to google's server - goes to port 80 by default
		- server at google will read request
		- push back appropriate content based on request 
		- sends back error if invalid request 
		- includes links to external resources (ie images, stylesheets, js, etc)
		- all external resrouces that are linked prompt additional requests from the server
